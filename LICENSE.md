WHY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE OWNED BY THE PROJECT OWNER
---------------------------------------
This project is a personal, long-term effort and is intended to remain under a 
single, unified ownership structure. This ensures that the project can be maintained, 
updated, or reorganized without the risk of conflicting ownership claims or disputes 
over contributed material.

This policy is not intended to diminish or disregard the value of contributions. 
It exists purely to avoid legal complications and to ensure the project remains 
coherent and manageable under one owner.

If the time comes where I am no longer able or willing to maintain this project, 
I may choose to relicense it under a more permissive or copy-left license but that 
decision will only occur if and when the project is formally discontinued.
