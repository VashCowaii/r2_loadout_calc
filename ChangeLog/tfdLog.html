        <li>Added a search feature, when text is entered in the input box, any tiles on the board that contain the text in the title, the internal stat name, or the proper stat name, will be highlighted orange, and only if you don't have them claimed yet
            <ul>
                <li>The idea is that you don't need to be familiar with the whole board to find what you need, you just need to know what you're after and this will show you were to get it</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to drag and zoom the board</li>
        <li>Added two columns underneath the board:
            <ul>
                <li>Claimed: this column shows a sum total of all bonuses currently acquired by the player with their active tiles. Any bonuses claimed are removed from the~</li>
                <li>Available: this column shows a sum total of all remaining bonuses on the board that the player has NOT yet acquired.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the entire board selection to the URL ~ yes, this will save in your links and you don't need to specify your whole board every time.</li>

        <h3>GENERAL - CALCULATOR</h3>
        <li>Updated the Fire Rate value cap to 2000 instead of the 6000 prior due to the recent game changes.</li>

                <li>Enemy Resistance (Skill Crit)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h3>ETA SHOP SCHEDULE</h3>
        <li>Added a new schedule for the remainder of Season 2 via episode 2</li>

    <h1>March 12, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed an error on the ETA shop page when no schedule was found(like in a scenario we're in right now where the schedules are over and we're waiting for the update)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 3, 2025 - THE COMPARISONS REWORK UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed how comparisons are targeted. Before, you needed to choose a specific combo under a single dropdown so ability + character mods, or ability + weapon mods. Now, you can choose a main target of ability, weapon, or character, and then I've added a new row of buttons to let you choose any gear you would like.</li>
        <li>At present, here are the gear choices available, and these can be used to compare under the main targets in any which way you'd like:
            <li>Character Mods</li>
            <li>Reactor Substats</li>
            <li>Weapon Mods</li>
            <li>Weapon Substats</li>
            <li>Weapon Cores</li>
            <li>Component Set Effects</li>
        </li>
        <li>Later we'll add the ability to use component substats as gear choices so you can directly quantify the impact of a Max MP roll on someone like Lepic or Ines.</li>
        <li>Added component sets to the gear choices under comparisons</li>
        <li>Removed all dropdown except the Aspect dropdown, and changed everything else to buttons instead. You win this time, unga-bunga users that dislike reading.</li>
        <li>Ability-based comparisons now display the ability icon instead of the ability name, since as mentioned above some of you are unable to read.</li>
        <li>Added Frost Watcher [WITHOUT ULTIMATE EFFECT] to the weapon selection. The effect will be added later.</li>

        <h3>NEW PAGE: STAT LOOKUP</h3>
        <li>Added a new page under the Resources tab that allows you to search for any statistic that the game uses, and you'll be met with the proper/internal name, as well as limitations on that statistic, and other assorted goodness.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>March 1, 2025 - COMPONENTS 2.0 & WEAPONS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the way weapon statistics are retrieved within the calculator. This is mostly a back-end change, but it does mean we can add just about any weapon to the calculator with less than 5 seconds of work, excluding ultimate abilities. As such, we're adding more weapons in this update.</li>
        <li>Added Enzo to the Buffs tab. You can toggle on Firearm Enhancement or Perfect Support. We'll adjust this later, but those are the bonuses all of you care about.</li>
        <li>Added the following ultimate weapons to the weapons selection WITH their ultimate abilities:
            <ul>
                <li>Enduring Legacy</li>
                <li>Perforator (Ability added)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following rare weapons to the weapon selection:
            <ul>
                <li>Tamer</li>
                <li>Vestigial Organ</li>
                <li>Death Roar</li>
                <li>Eternal Willpower</li>
                <li>Phantom Pain</li>
                <li>Caligo's Horn</li>
                <li>Magnus AA</li>
                <li>Lion of Blue Mane</li>
                <li>Unfinished Study</li>
                <li>Rascal V-51</li>
                <li>Alter Ego</li>
                <li>Devil's Call</li>
                <li>New Beginning</li>
                <li>Rose of Aisha</li>
                <li>Millennium Frost</li>
                <li>Red Wolf</li>
                <li>Guardian R4</li>
                <li>Lightspeed Barrel</li>
                <li>Fireworks</li>
                <li>The Last Knight</li>
                <li>Subconsciousness</li>
                <li>In a Blink</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following common weapons to the weapon selection:
            <ul>
                <li>Hungry Hound</li>
                <li>Ominous Hound</li>
                <li>Cygnus</li>
                <li>Albinism</li>
                <li>Tamed Beast</li>
                <li>Gangster</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the bonuses provided by the following component sets:
            <ul>
                <li>Bravery</li>
                <li>Volcanic - now has weapon specific attack bonuses</li>

                <li>Frozen Heart</li>
                <li>Hungry Sonic</li>

                <li>Decimator</li>
                <li>Venom Essence</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated Wave of Light ultimate ability to separate Lunar Halo from Solar Halo, meaning that Lunar falls off after 10s whereas Solar falls off after 2 seconds.</li>

        <h3>EDGE CASE RELOAD FIXES</h3>
        Finally figured out what was causing some weird bugs I could see after a reload. The bug caused microscopic timing errors in the DPS evaluations, and while minimal, it irked me. Now we're chilling though.
        <li>Fixed an edge case for duration based effects that could expire during a reload but despite meeting the conditions to be applied again after the reload finished, did not actually get applied again.</li>
        <li>Similar to the above, fixed an edge case where if expired during a reload, some duration based effects did not properly account for the ranged in time buffer when resetting their cooldowns.</li>
        <li>Fixed an edge case where stacking effects with substack values that were not the same as the value applied on the first stack didn't always properly negate the right values after the effect expired during a reload.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where stacking effects that trigger based on the first shot in a magazine but do not apply to that first shot itself, did not properly reset the stack count after a reload.</li>

        <h3>FIXES</h3>
        <li>Fixed an issue that prevented the weak point parts list from populating after loading a build from a prior URL.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo the circulation mods descriptions.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error causing 1 extra stack to apply on Tenacious Hunter</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>

    <ul>
        <li>Added Wave of Light and its ultimate weapon ability to the weapon selection</li>

                    <li>Analysis Master</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </li>
        <li>I'd normally say I added Beam Rifle Charge speed as a statistic in this update, but I didn't. I honestly don't recall when I added it, but it's there!</li>
        <li>Fixed a display issue that could happen when a Common weapon type(blue) was equipped.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Added Gley and all abilities + transcendent mods to the calculator.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the Gunbarrel mods were considered to be a separate category from the Priority mods. The end result of which is they could show up in comparisons they shouldn't be in. This didn't break any math, was just a visual issue.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Feb 19, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated weak point damage math to include the recent change to attribute damage(it can now weakpoint, jesus christ)</li>

    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Feb 16, 2025 - THE ENEMY STATS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>

                <li>Any named enemy in the entire game can be searched here</li>
                <li>Data is pulled for any level increment of 5. So lvl 2, 3 and 4 won't populate, but 5, 10, and 15 etc will, all the way up to the maximum level possible for that enemy.</li>
                <li>Some enemies have levels in their stats for levels that don't get used in game. Yet.</li>

</div>
<div>
    <h1>Feb 15, 2025</h1>

        <li>Fixed an issue where DPS comparisons didn't pull the maximum fire rate bonus when cycling through alternative options in that slots.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where fire rate % bonuses were capped at 95% instead of the 90 it should have been.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the battle proficiency mods for General Rounds modules didn't work. This was exclusive to General Rounds.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where mods with reload-based conditions didn't trigger properly if more than one was equipped.</li>

<div>
    <h1>Feb 13, 2025 - THE DPS UPDATE [Part 1]</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>CORES X</h3>
        <li>Updated and added values for all cores up to Tier X</li>

        <h3>COMPARISONS</h3>
        <li>Added AVG DPS as an option for weapons comparison aspects.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to compare weapon core choices against all others in the comparison tool. The comparisons will only show other options based on the color of the core slot you're comparing against, versus what you have selected in that slot already.</li>
        <li>Added "buttons" to click/tap on the comparisons for easily accessed swaps between targets, instead of needing to use the dropdown every time. This is currently available for the following comparison types:
            <ul>
                <li>Abilities</li>
                <li>Abilities - Weapon Based</li>
                <li>Abilities - Reactor Rolls</li>
                <li>Character Stats</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated handling on the following comparisons to ignore duplicates of the stat in the other slot so it doesn't try to tell you to equip colossus ATK twice anymore:
            <ul>
                <li>Reactor Rolls</li>
                <li>Weapon Substats</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h3>RELOAD & DPS</h3>

        <li>Added the ability to specify the number of magazines you want to use when factoring your weapon damage across a larger spread of reloads and time.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to specify an early breakpoint for reloading. So if you want to only shoot for 2 seconds then immediately reload, you can toggle custom reloads and specify that time.</li>

        <h3>GENERAL & CALC</h3>
        <li>Added the following new statistics to weapon substats and cores:
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Added missing mods, or improved functionality relating to the newly added reload code, on the following weapon modules:
            <ul>
                <li>Descendant Roll (New)</li>
                <li>Recycling Genius (New)</li>
                <li>Dopaminergic Activate (New)</li>

                <li>Accelerated Driveshaft</li>
                <li>Improve Driveshaft</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Improved conditionals on the following modules:
            <ul>
                <li>Payout - now only applies to bullet simulations that include firearm damage. Skills that only deal skill damage, can't proc it, but skills that do, will.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following new weapons:
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Blue Blood Bloomer</li>
                <li>Firefly</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following new enemy selections:
            <ul>
                <li>Lgn. [260] Truth</li>
                <li>Lgn. [260] Immortality</li>
                <li>Lgn. [260] Darkness</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Clicking a mod row will now auto-focus the text input related to that module. Also, when entering a mod name into the aforementioned text box, after submitting the new mod name, the displayed mod tab will cycle to the next module and also auto-focus the next text box. This should help cycle inputs faster and make it less tedious.</li>
        <li>Ultimate weapon ability bonuses will no longer apply to unique weapons within the calculator. AKA: Secret Garden will no longer populate within unique ability weapons, as it doesn't in game either.</li>
        <li>Weapon substats now recolor according to their rarity bracket: blue, purple, and gold.</li>
        <li>Reactor, weapon, and component tabs now recolor based on their rarity, between Ultimate and Purple</li>
        <li>Added the perfect release damage multiplier toggle to Ines' 3rd ability when Time of the Hunting Hounds is equipped, in-line with recent fixes to the game.</li>

        <h3>REACTOR FARMS</h3>
        <li>Updated farm ratings on some locations.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error that prevented component filters from functioning properly.</li>

        <h3>EROSIONS</h3>
        <li>Updated the erosion level modifiers to reflect the recent changes to on-attribute scaling for firearms.</li>

        <h3>FIXES, CHANGES & OPTIMIZATION</h3>
        <li>Updated the "Team" tab name to "Buffs" instead.</li>
        <li>Optimized handling for limited duration ability weapon like Overkill, Baptism, etc. Before we were doing things in a way that could cause some major lag as each input was modified, now that shouldn't be an issue anymore.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where some modules with special functions would apply to a unique weapon, but not a regular weapon afterwards, if a character with a unique weapon was equipped.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a build was loaded from an existing link URL parameter, the boss parts list wouldn't populate properly based on the selected boss until the boss was removed and reselected.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where skill duration on a reactor roll didn't always properly factor on some skills that were calculated early for bonuses</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if no weapon was selected, the bullet chart still tried to chart out each shot, but couldn't, and would display errors on the browser console. This was purely visual and didn't impact performance in any way, but I had meant to fix this for a while.</li>
        <li>Fixed an error where if you tried to select the same reactor substat twice on a single reactor, it could break the comparison function. Results would still generate, but the result it was comparing against was the same for each one afterwards even if you changed it something different.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Fusion Integration didn't have a rarity specified, and when selected didn't color the mod slot correctly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Fusion and Singular integration displayed the incorrect polarity symbols.</li>
        <li>Further improved bullet simulation logic across the board, added the ability to handle various different things that we'll talk about later.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Feb 6, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>EROSIONS</h3>
        <li>Added a new page to the resources tab that breaks down every modifier in each Void Erosion Purge level.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Jan 30, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added colossus stagger, frenzy, and rage values/ranges.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Jan 22, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue where old links prior to yesterday's update, didn't always populate correctly due to missing the new URL paramters</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Jan 21, 2024 - THE WEAPON CORES UPDATE</h1>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/kZvQT4r6Vjg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #93CCEA;">A video detailing the core system, here</a>
    <ul>
        <h3>CORES</h3>
        <li>Added the new weapon core system. When an ultimate weapon is selected, core options specific to that weapon will populate.
            <ul>
                <li>Remember that weapon cores do not carry over to Unique Weapons summoned from abilities.</li>
                <li>If a non-ultimate weapon is selected, cores are disabled, deselected, and cleared from the stat tables.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Core selections now save to the URL for "saving" just like weapon option stats and selections.</li>

        <h3>GENERAL</h3>
        <li>The currently selected enemy, as well as the currently targeted part, now save to the URL parameters</li>
        <li>Added base attribute attack to any weapons currently supported on the calculator that received them in the latest update.</li>
        <li>Added support for the following weapons:
            <ul>
                <li>Hero's Scar</li>
                <li>Silly Weeper</li>
                <li>Nightmare Hound</li>
                <li>The Age Of Innovation</li>
                <li>Sonic Co-op</li>
                <li>Explorer's Path</li>
                <li>Burning Hound</li>
                <li>Immediate Execution</li>
                <li>Different Dream</li>
                <li>Forest Gaze</li>
                <li>Supermoon Z-15</li>
                <li>Recipient Unknown</li>
                <li>Belief</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h3>FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the roll cancel duration of a unique weapon could carry over to time wasted on a regular weapon chart for any duration based effects, if a character with a unique weapon was selected while a weapon with a time-based mod was equipped.</li>
        <li>Fixed Targeted Vulnerability (Shotgun) showing a crit damage category mod instead of weak point strike.</li>
        <li>Reverted a change that made it so when a rare weapon was selected, the Ultimate toggle on reactors was forcibly toggled off. Given that reactor implants are class based now instead of weapon based, this isn't needed anymore.
            <ul>
                <li>On the same note, Ultimate status of a reactor is now saved to the URL for the weird fetishists who want to save a suboptimal reactor in their links.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Improved logic for default population values when selecting a new statistic under reactors, weapon substats, or weapon cores, on an empty slot or a slot that changed statistics.</li>
        <li>Improved responsiveness on some weapon section displays on mobile view.</li>
        <li>Updated the Changelog page to display TFD by default instead of Remnant 2 going forward.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Jan 18, 2025 - THE INES UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Ines along with all associated abilities, transcendent mods, and breakdowns.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to compare currently selected reactor substats against all other possible maximum value options such as the difference between Fire Skill Ratio and Colossus ATK on Lepic.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to compare currently selected weapon substats against all other possible maximum value options such as the difference between Firearm ATK% and Colossus ATK on Smithereens.</li>
        <li>Fixed images not populating for Sigvore parts on the ETA shop schedule page.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Ines' 4th skill didn't factor the Conductor toggle properly.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Jan 16, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added stats for Defiler and removed Infernal Walker as a selectable colossus.
            <ul>
                <li>Also updated the statistics for Obstructer and Frost Walker in line with the changes that allow them to queue solo.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added misc. images required for future ETA rotations</li>
        <li>Updated parsing for reactor rotations to include the changes to the permanent drops in White Night Gulch and Echo Swamp</li>
        <li>Updated parsing for the ETA shop schedule to allow for Sigvore's being introduced between either shop going forward in the weekly rotations.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Jan 11, 2025 - THE BLAIR & SHOTGUN UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Blair along with all associated abilities, transcendent mods, and breakdowns.</li>
        <li>Added the ability for bullet simulation to account for weapons that shoot more than one pellet per shell, such as shotguns.</li>
        <li>In line with the point above, added code for Smithereens. Other shotguns will follow later.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to compare weapon damage with limited comparison targets for now which are the following:
            <ul>
                <li>AVG DMG per shot</li>
                <li>SUM AVG DMG per magazine</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Freyna's bullet cutoffs were based on the maximum possible instead of the total magazine.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with the embed display on the ETA or reactor pages where when linked in discord, the embed title still said "TFD Home" as if it were an embed for the home page.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Dec 24, 2024 - THE REACTOR SCHEDULE UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the Reactor farm page under the resources tab that provides a schedule as well as farm ratings for every zone.</li>
        <li>Added all the new weapon mods for Impact Rounds, I'll circle back and add the others later.</li>
        <li>Reworked the Firearm Advantage multiplier calculations to account for new testing based on the Overwhelm mod, now we know the colossi bonus is an additive 10%.</li>
        <li>Fixed the renamed Attribute Intensive mods to Integration</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Dec 20, 2024 - THE S2 PART 2/3 - SHAREN & BULLET SIM UDATE</h1>
    The new weapon mods are not included in this update, nor are reload factors for the new feature: bullet simulation. Those will be added next week.
    <ul>
        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <h4>- NEW</h4>
        <li>Added Sharen along with all associated abilities, transcendent mods, and breakdowns.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to compare weapon mods against ability results, which is mainly for unique weapons and includes but is not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Hailey's Zenith</li>
                <li>Lepic's Overkill</li>
                <li>Freyna's Baptism</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added Bullet Simulation
            <ul>
                <li>This can apply to both firearm breakdowns as well as unique weapon breakdowns as mentioned earlier</li>
                <li>This allows you to map out and chart accurate values to mods that are normally very difficult to visualize or approximate, such as the following
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sharp Precision Shot</li>
                        <li>Mental Focus</li>
                        <li>Real Life Fighter</li>
                        <li>Weak Point Expansion</li>
                        <li>etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Later this will include reload factors but they couldn't ship in this update.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to specify your weak point hit rate next to crit or weakpoint allowance settings.</li>
        <li>Added an averaged weak point hit multiplier to the main stat column.</li>
        <li>Added a new statistic to differentiate between FirearmATK% and debuffed enemies that receive more ATK%, as there is a difference.</li>
        <li>Overhauled most complex mods to have function-based benefits that factor into bullet simulations</li>
        <li>Disabled Secret Garden's damage breakdown for now as burst rifles are complicated for bullet simulation. This will be reenabled later.</li>

        <h3>BOSS STATS</h3>
        <li>Updated the following bosses HP/Stats based on the recent nerfs
            <ul>
                <li>Gluttony</li>
                <li>Molten Fortress</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h4>- FIXES</h4>
        <li>Fixed an issue where some abilities had improperly set comparsion targets, and could break when targeted using the Compare tab</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where some mods couldn't be selected due to an extra space attached to the end of their name</li>
        <li>Fixed various typos on modules.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Dec 14, 2024 - THE S2 UPDATE PART 1/3</h1>
    There are still more character updates and additional mods/gear that will be coming this weekend.<br>
    A large rework to the weapon section is coming soon as well.
    <ul>
        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <h4>- Reactors</h4>
        <li>Added handling to allow reactor enhancement level specification from 0 to 5
            <ul>
                <li>The default level assumption will always be 2</li>
                <li>The specified level is now saved and added to the URL parameters.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a toggle called Ultimate that lets you specify whether your reactor is ultimate or not
            <ul>
                <li>This does modify the weapon optimization condition from 60% to 40%</li>
                <li>This also restricts the max enhancement level of a reactor to 2 instead of 5, as rare reactors cannot go beyond lvl 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When a new weapon is selected, the following triggers occur in the reactor selection:
            <ul>
                <li>If the weapon is ultimate, the Ulty toggle will be flipped on. If not, it will be flipped off</li>
                <li>The weapon's ammo type will automatically be assigned in the reactor selection, however I still let you as the user change the ammo type on the reactor only because there are still some skill that pull from the reactor ammo type like lepic or freyna when it comes to determining fire rate if you have Sharp Precision Shot on. This will change later, but for now this works.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Renamed the "Reactor Weapon Matched" to "Weapon Condition" under the reactor tab</li>
        <li>Removed the "Weapon Conditions" header that hung over the ammo type selection.</li>

        <h4>- Season 2 Changes</h4>
        <li>Added the new Hunter component set</li>
        <li>Updated calculations for the following characters and their associated changes that released with season 2:
            <ul>
                <li>Viessa</li>
                <li>Jayber</li>
                <li>Luna</li>
                <li>Esiemo</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the following unique weapon abilities for the same reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>Blue Beetle</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h4>- General</h4>
        <li>Updated the main calculator page to use the new boss data system we pushed to the boss stats page yesterday. This means you not only have access to more data on the calculator per boss, but also now have access to Infernal Walker, as well as every boss in normal mode for those who wanted it.
            <ul>
                <li>This means bosses are assigned a single letter suffix in the selections, so Devourer Hard Mode is (H) but normal mode is (N) and Infernal Walker is assigned an (A) as it is Abyss difficulty</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Renamed the following tabs:
            <ul>
                <li>"Player" to "Skills"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Changed the hovered cursor in numerous places to be a pointer hand instead of the standard mouse cursor, in an attempt to make functions clearer where applicable</li>

        

    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Dec 12, 2024 - THE ETA SHOP UPDATE</h1>

    There are still character updates and additional mods/gear that will be coming this weekend.
    <ul>
        <h3>ETA Shop Schedule</h3>
        <li>Added ETAShop under the resources tab of TFD navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Added all data for all upcoming weeks on the ETA shop offerings</li>
        <li>Added a boatload of images relevant to shop offerings</li>

        <h3>BOSS PAGE</h3>
        <li>Changed the formatting of the page to be a selection instead of a list</li>
        <li>Added handling to automatically find and populate all weak points on a boss for the sake of wp modifiers</li>
        <li>Added the following info:
            <ul>
                <li>Boss HP</li>
                <li>A whole lot of other boss stats</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a special weapon was selected (aka: secret garden, the only special weapon the calculator supported) then the URL parameters didn't save the mods as a special weapon but rather as an impact weapon meaning a page refresh would load mods that didn't always match what they should have been since impact and special are handled and ordered differently.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Nov 17, 2024 - THE LUNA CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <li>Added Luna to the character dropdown and added breakdowns for all her abilities and transcendent mods
            <ul>
                <li>On top of that, I've added her as the first Team option for buffs. Simply toggle it on, input the Luna's total MP amount, select which buffs are active and which one is enhanced, and it'll populate into your character stats accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the Impact Rounds "Edging Shot" description didn't reflect the proper stat amount at max rank. The mod's stats in the code were right, just an issue on the description.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if Kyle had Last Stand equipped, Superconductivity Thrusters only showed the AVG Last Stand bonus but not on a regular hit or crit.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo on Arche Concretion</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo on Emergency Measures description</li>

        <h3>BUILDS PAGE</h3>
        <li>Renamed the dropdown that links here, to "Builds & Guides" instead of "Vash's Builds"</li>
        <li>Added a list of all builds and guides made by myself or Lian, and converted it all into a filterable table</li>
        <li>Added the ability to filter the displayed builds by type (guide, build, etc.) or by the entity (executor, bunny, etc.)</li>

        <h3>TFD HOME PAGE</h3>
        <li>Added handling to automatically choose the latest video to use on the home page, assuming I've at least added the video to a database in my code. Before, I had to go in each time and edit the actual homepage HTML, and I disliked doing that.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!-- <li>Added URL logging for character-specific settings, like say Hailey's cold fury stack count. Those were pretty much the only things left that I didn't add to data persistence yet, but now that is done.</li> -->
 <div>
    <h1>Nov 12, 2024 - THE TOOLTIPS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Finished adding tooltips to the entirety of the main stat column. Not only should there be a brief overview to the stat or how it is calculated, but it will also display a list of all currently selected items, abilities, etc. that CAN contribute to the stat so that way if you're getting numbers you're confused on maybe you forgot you have Secret Garden equipped, you can hover over Power Optimization and it'll tell you the bonus is coming from the Reactor Weapon Match like it should, but it'll also display Secret Garden's weapon ability. If you're curious about where that extra bit of DEF is coming from it'll tell you everything that can add it, so on and so forth.</li>
        <li>Added a restriction ruleset on how the final crit damage multiplier is obtained for both skills and firearms, specifically regarding how it handles its decimal values.
            <ul>
                <li>There's still more to be done here to confirm this is how it actually works, but at a glance things line up how they should with the added rules. If it can be disproven, I'll revert this change, but until then we're rollin with it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Modified the restriction ruleset on how DEF, not RES, handles its decimals to be in-line with how CDMG handles theirs, which lines up for DEF stuff.</li>
        <li>Removed the "SKILL ATTACK" category from the main column since it only served to house the colossus bonus skill atk stat, and moved it to the power ratios category next to power optimization instead.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where some component substats would not get pulled properly, in particular things like MP recovery modifier or shield regen in combat. Things like HP, MP, and DEF have always worked though, the reason this happened was due to a disconnect in my earlier naming schemes that I changed later but didn't update in that code and never noticed until I was adding tooltips for them.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the UI displayed Esiemo's Madness buff as Skill Power not Power Optimization. The math still used it as Optimization like it should have.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 11, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>Mod Comparisons</h3>
        <li>Added the ability to target generalized player statistics, whereas before you could only target ability aspects.</li>
        <li>Added the following options under "Stat" targets:
            <ul>
                <li>Max HP</li>
                <li>Max Shield</li>
                <li>Max MP</li>
                <li>DEF</li>
                <li>Resist - Fire</li>
                <li>Resist - Chill</li>
                <li>Resist - Toxin</li>
                <li>Resist - Electric</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Moved the comparisons tool up to a new tab at the top called "Compare"</li>
        <li>Reworked the comparison UI to be more mobile friendly.</li>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <li>Added the first batch of tooltips to the main stat column.
            <ul>
                <li>Still more work to be done here and they haven't been added to everything just yet. Also, later I'll have it so it'll not only tell you about the stat but also tell you everything in your gear that is adding to it</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the structure needed to do keyword-color-tagging in descriptions. Now I just need to add all the keys. This is for stuff like Cold Fury in Hailey's Description, in-game it is changed to blue text and highlighted, and that's what this code will do.</li>
        <li>Moved the "Player" and "Enemy" settings to tabs up near where the Character/Weapon display toggle used to be, and changed the toggle to a tabbing system instead to allow me to better manage UI space with new things I might add later.</li>
        <li>Added a display to enemy settings that will notify users of the enemy part weakness as well as weak point bonus if applicable</li>
        <li>The following user inputs will now save to the URL length:
            <ul>
                <li>Reactor Weapon Match (the 1.6x bonus or not)</li>
                <li>Current Display Tab (Character, weapon, team, enemy etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Renamed the "Charge Integration" mods to "Bullet Integration" which used to also be called "Charge Intensive"</li>
        <li>Fixed a mislabeled weakness type on the recently added lvl1 immortality and darkness enemy selections. This was purely a display issue, the weakness type behind the scenes was still correct.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the 60% bonus from the matching reactor weapon didn't show up in the main stat column under power optimization. It still factored into the math as it should have, was just an error in how the UI pulled the numbers.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h1>Nov 9, 2024 - THE DEF FORMULA UPDATE</h1>
    If you're not familiar, we sorted out the actual DEF formula, and this brings changes to the resistances values we use and the resulting values we get from them.
    <a href="https://youtu.be/7fWFPwAflMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #93CCEA;">See the latest video for better info</a>
    <ul>
        <li>In line with our recent discoveries, we have updated all the resistance values that are displayed and used by the calculator. We should have much more accurate values now.</li>
        <li>Added the following resistance reduction effects now that we can calculate them accurately:
            <ul>
                <li>Nazeistra's Devotion</li>
                <li>Venom Injection's Corrosion (Freyna)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added Power Optimization to be visible in the main stat column under the Power Ratio section.</li>
        <li>Added the following to the enemy resistance selection dropdown
            <ul>
                <li>LvL 1 Legion of Darkness</li>
                <li>LvL 1 Legion of Immortality</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Fixed an issue where Hailey's zenith weapon side damage, on the physical damage, didn't have the right multiplier. This was due to a recent change I made in how ability stats get pulled, so that's my bad.</li>
        <li>Fixed another issue that could pop up when a character was removed while a transcendent mod was equippped.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Swamp Walker's body type was listed as Pierce instead of Burst</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Oct 31, 2024 - THE VIESSA CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Viessa to the character selection, along with breakdowns for all abilities and transcendent mods.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where weapon substat flat attribute attack bonuses could sometimes not reflect in the weapon damage breakdown, more precisely the attribute display wouldn't populate if there was only an attribute attack bonus with no enhancement mods. (thank you turbo for the report)</li>
        <li>Added a structure that will allow me to work on character calculations without altering the code that gets shipped out to the live site each update, that way I don't accidentally ship out part of a character. Keen-eyed code viewers noticed in the last update I accidentally shipped out Viessa's ability functions before Viessa herself, but that is something you'd have only seen in the code. In theory, that shouldn't happen anymore.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a character had a transcendent mod active but the character was removed from the selections, it could break the calculator.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 28, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Nazeistra's Devotion to the weapon dropdown. Its unique ability is not yet factored, but will be soon.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Impact Rounds "Expand Weapon Charge" reflected as a Malachite polarity instead of Cerulean.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Impact Rounds "Weak Point Sight" module did not get properly factored into the weak point damage equation.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 25, 2024 - THE MOD COMPARISONS UPDATE + JAYBER BUT WHO CARES</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>MOD COMPARISONS</h3>

        <li>Added the ability to compare one mod you have selected, against all other possible mods that could fit in that slot, in order to determine if there are better options for your build in that mod slot</li>
        <li>Comparisons only work on abilities right now, and you need to select what ability you want to get values for, as well as what aspect you want to compare with:
            <ul>
                <li>An example would be Lepic's grenade throw. You might want to compare the total damage of a single grenade, or you the DPS of the grenade throw overall while also considering cooldowns. You have to choose what part you want to compare on.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Comparisons will not populate if you have no mods equipped, or if the ability isn't meant to be compared. An example would be an ability that gives you a bonus to your stats but does nothing else, there is no point in comparing what your mods do there.</li>
        <li>Comparisons do not function on transcendent or sub-attack modules, nor do I do comparisons for weapon modules. Yet. Weapons soon though.</li>

        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>

        <li>Added Jayber to the character selection, along with breakdowns for all abilities and transcendent mods.</li>
        <li>Added a slider to enemy settings, that dictates your Dangerous Ambush (Immobile) uptime. This slider directly modifies the bonus given by the mod, and defaults at 100% so that way people who don't notice it don't get confused by custom amounts.</li>
        <li>Completed all remaining unfinished abilities, transcendent mods, and UI revamp for the following characters, including hook-ups to the mod comparison tool:
            <ul>
                <li>Lepic</li>
                <li>Kyle</li>
                <li>Hailey</li>
                <li>Bunny (her 4th skill at base still needs testing that I'll do later, it's a weird one)</li>
                <li>Esiemo</li>
                <li>Freyna</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added support for the Last Stand mod, specifically in Kyle's Superconductivity Thrusters skill damage.</li>
        <li>Added a toggle to restrict Lepic's overkill duration my the maximum duration that would be allowed by your maximum MP.</li>
        <li>Added support for dynamic sprint speed bonuses on Bunny's Lightning Emission skill, to be modified by the various speed bonuses provided by her other abilities. This will also allow me to factor in sprint speed bonuses provided by weapons or modules in the future.</li>
        <li>Added toggles for each sprint speed bonus provided by any of Bunny's abilities or transcendent mods(even bionic, sadge)</li>
        <li>Added support for all aspects of Esiemo's Madness and Narcissism buffs, so the -DEF, the firearm ATK%, etc. will now factor into character and weapon statistics where applicable.</li>
        <li>Added Duration and Fire Rate restrictions for Freyna's Venom Baptism. This way people can see how many shots they have time for, vs how many shots they can actually manage.</li>
        <li>Added support for Freyna's Venom Injection transcendent mod to check if a 1-HP mod is equipped and force the HP slider down to 0% and ensure the maximum bonus is applied without the user needing to be aware of it. Conversely, if you have no 0-HP mods equipped, the calculator will ensure you cannot go below 15%HP on the slider.</li>
        <li>Added Peace Maker to the weapon dropdown, and added its unique weapon ability to factor in stacks to player stats when applicable.</li>
        <li>Renamed the following settings from "Use" to "Allow" for better clarity in regards to what they do. For example, physical type bonuses or part-specific weak point modifiers will be automatically adjusted or even disabled depening on the target selected and their corresponding weakpoints. "Use" make it sound like it will happen always when selected, but "Allow" implies that when it can happen, you're letting it still factor in:
            <ul>
                <li>"Allow Weak Points?"</li>
                <li>"Allow Crits?"</li>
                <li>"Allow Physical Bonus?"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Maximize Duration had a negative power modifier of -20% instead of the -21.1% it should be.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Lepic's overkill shot count display could be one shot off on edge case duration amounts.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where swapping to Esiemo as your selected character didn't always update the total bombs placed amount correctly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the description for Blue Beetle's unique ability listed as Secret Garden's. This didn't modify the ability, only the description.</li>
        <li>Fixed a typo on the Transcendent mod overview header</li>

        <h3>BUILDS PAGE</h3>
        <li>Updateds builds page and home page recent video link</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 17, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added an extremely basic damage overview for whatever your selected weapon is, in Weapon Mode. This will be expanded upon more later.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to select a target body part on the enemy selected for resistances:
            <ul>
                <li>Part-specific weakpoint modifiers will now automatically adjust based on the part selected. This also means that if you select Body which obviously can't hit weakpoints, that means weakpoints will also automatically be disabled.</li>
                <li>Part-specific physical type bonuses(crush, pierce, burst) will now automatically adjust based on the part selected. This also means the type bonus will disable automatically when you are selecting a body part with a weakness that is not applicable to the physical type of your weapon. This also means in the future when I add enemy selections for regular vulgus, it will automatically adjust the amount of the type bonus too.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Non-Attribute characters could pop an error when obtaining the Boss DR related to non-attribute, failing to validate the display numbers. This was caused when I made a change to how character abilities retrieve boss DR to apply, and Non-Attribute having a hyphen in the attribute name tripped it.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 15, 2024 - THE FREYNA CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>BOSS STATS</h3>
        <li>Added resistances, weak point modifiers, and crit resists for Death Stalker</li>
        <li>Updated Gluttony's new crit resists</li>

        <h3>CALCULATOR</h3>
        <li>Added the new "Amplification" and "Intensive" modules</li>
        <li>Added ability calculations and breakdowns for Freyna along with all her abilities and Transcendent Mods.</li>
        <li>Added the function to automatically adjust crit resist depending on which boss you have selected. You can still manually adjust crit res after selecting a boss, but when the boss is first selected the crit resist will be adjusted to that boss to save you time.</li>
        <li>Added unique weapon abilities to the following weapons, that will now factor into character and weapon stats:
            <ul>
                <li>Blue Beetle</li>
                <li>Secret Garden</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added Special Rounds modules, purely for the sake of being able to add in Secret Garden support as listed earlier.</li>
        <li>Revamped the ability breakdown UI for the following characters and all their abilities:
            <ul>
                <li>Hailey</li>
                <li>Freyna</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following categories to the main Stats Column:
            <ul>
                <li>Firearm Crit</li>
                <li>Firearm Weak Point</li>
                <li>Firearm ATK</li>
                <li>Firearm Attribute</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following General Settings:
            <ul>
                <li>Use Weakspot Hits</li>
                <li>Use Critical Hits</li>
                <li>Use Physical Type Bonus</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Colossus attibute resistance was not being factored into bunny's Lightning Emission calcs.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Range displays could show the incorrect value in relation to the ability's specific range limit.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if someone was mentally unstable and toggled options at the speed of light, sometimes the options wouldn't toggle properly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where components with excessively long descriptions could sometimes take up too much space and cause other displays within the components box to get pushed out of view.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Oct 5, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added extra ability statistics (range, cost, etc.) to ALL the abilities of the following characters and their transcendent mods:
            <ul>Esiemo</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Re-enabled the remainder of Esiemo's ability breakdowns that had been disabled after the rework, since I hadn't gotten to all of his skills just yet to confirm values, but now that is done.</li>
        <li>Updated the description of Esiemo's Adventitious Habit passive to reflect the phrasing change to on hit instead of depleted shields.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 30, 2024 - THE ESIEMO CALCS AND BOSS RESISTS UPDATE</h1>
    I had to change a lot of things in this update to make life easier in the future. As such, if you see anything jank, please let me know in the discord.
    <ul>
        <li>Added calculations for Esiemo and ALL his abilities and transcendent mods, and updated ability breakdowns for Kyle
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the math was done before their rework update, so some are temporarily disabled until I can confirm all of their math is still the same, which should not take me very long to do. Only reason they aren't done already is because I was playing Remnant 2's new DLC.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added resistance data for all bosses to the boss stats page, but also added a dropdown on the calculator page to allow users to choose the boss they want to see numbers adjusted to. This means that without needing to go and attack a boss, you can tell how much damage you will deal to it just from lookin at the calc. I'll have a video on this out separately, later.</li>
        <li>Added support for the following ability breakdowns for characters that did not have them before:
            <ul>
                <li>Bunny: Electric Condense</li>
                <li>Bunny: Thrill Bomb</li>
                <li>Hailey: Storm Snare</li>
                <li>Hailey: Cryo Round</li>
                <li>Lepic: Overclock</li>
                <li>Lepic: Power Unit Change</li>
                <li>Lepic: Nerve Infiltration</li>
                <li>Lepic: Traction Grenade</li>
                <li>Lepic: Firearm Master</li>
                <li>Lepic: Regenerative Braking</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Started adding ability specific statistics to each ability breakdown, so say what the range is or maybe an ability has more than 1 range stat to factor in, they'll display in rows beneath the discription.
            <ul>
                <li>I have NOT added this to every ability yet, but I will. Only clarifying this so if you see it pop up on some but not others, that's why. When I add descendant math in the future for new characters, I'll have it already for them, but I'll have to circle back to older additions to my calc and add them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where URL logging didn't properly retain the values a user input. It kept the stat names correctly, but the values were lost on a page load which would force the value to register as zero, causing the calc to automatically provided the highest values possible for the associated rolls. Note that reactors did not have this issue, only component substat numbers.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where weapon attribute damage on Zenith wouldn't populate for anything but Chill damage</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on the boss stats page, Gluttony listed its weak point physical types(pierce, burst, etc.) to be the same as Devourer's, which isn't correct. Only the physical type images were incorrect, the rest of of Gluttony's info is fine.</li>
    
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 18, 2024</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Renamed the old crit sliders from ceiling to resistance. Forgot to do that after the crit res video.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 17, 2024 - THE HAILEY CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Add URL gear logging. This means that your selections are saved in case you refresh or use the link that it generates in your browser, to open the same build back up later
            <ul>
                <li>Note that right now, character settings, so like Hailey cold fury stacks, are not saved to the URL. I'm still debating how I want to structure character settings in there. If I make it now when I'm not sure how I want to do it, then I'll break it later when I change it to how I want it. Will think for a bit on this part.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added calculations and breakdowns for Hailey and her Zenith skill.
            <ul>
                <li>This includes the first draft of the weapon side of the calculator. Right now it is only for specifying what weapon or stats or mods you're using on your stat stick for hailey, but your selections DO impact her zenith skill damage breakdown.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed several mods that had incorrect polarities in the descendant modules.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 6, 2024 - THE KYLE CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Kyle in the character selection, and added dmg calcs for his 2's transcendant mod and both his 4 and 4's transcendant mod as well.</li>
        <li>Added Kyle Build to the Vash Builds page</li>
        <li>When I published this update, Kyle's 4th transcendant mod still showed the correct numbers instead of the bugged numbers like I talk about in the Kyle video. Shortly after this update went out I put out an update that brought the numbers back to the bugged numbers, as that is the current state of the game. Will change this when it is patched in game.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Dangerous Ambush added together both the non-targeting bonus and the immobilized bonus. Now it only adds the immobilized bonus like it should.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on the Vash Build's page while the link's names were changed, they still linked to some Remnant 2 videos.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 5, 2024 - BUNNY EMISSION CALCS UPDATE</h1>
    As mentioned yesterday, we had bunny calcs on their own page prior to today, but now we've merged them into the main calc where no manual value input is needed anymore, just say what you're using and look at the numbers.
    <ul>
        <li>Added Bunny as a character option and merged her emission/HV calcs from her character specific page to this main calc. Deleted the old bunny page.</li>
        <li>Added Bunny Transcendant mods.</li>
        <li>Added functionality that will actively add or remove transcendant mods from the available dropdown options in the first mod slot, based on which character you have selected or are switching to.</li>
        <li>Updated the conversion values of Overwhelming HP and Overwhelming Shield as per the game's update today.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that stopped +ATK vs Colossus to factor into skill calculations.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where enough conversion mods could bring your max HP into the negative</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the 12th mod slot could not be returned to after clicking off of it</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where a typo caused the 9th mod slot's stats and description to fail to populate</li>
        <li>Fixed augment descriptions for two of lepic's transcendant mods.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Sept 4, 2024 - THE TFD CALC INTRO UPDATE</h1>

    We'd technically had character-specific calcs up for Lepic and Bunny, but they were manual value input and nowhere near as user-friendly or the level of work I had put into my remnant calculator. Now, however, I'm going just as indepth on the TFD side of things. This will take time, but today marks the release of our first rough draft of sorts.
    <ul>
        <li>Added a TFD Homepage, as well as a TFD icon on the sidenav bar</li>
        <li>Added a Build Calc page, and removed the Lepic specifc page and merged it into this page. The bunny-specific calc still exists on its own page, I just need to do some conversions in order to move it from the separated page into the general use one, which I will do later.</li>
        <li>Added a "Vash's Builds" page for TFD build like I did with the R2 side of the site.</li>
        <li>Added a shit load of images, files, etc. for everything I'm gonna need for now. Probably going to add a lot more later as well.</li>

        <li>Fixed an issue where only 10 mod slots populated instead of 12, due to the augment and sub mods taking up space where they shouldn't have.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Overwhelming HP mod would cause NaN displays on some associated defensive stat displays in the main stat column.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if you swapped a mod in the same slot to another mod that happened to have the same mod category(attack, arche tech, battle, etc.) it would react as if you were selecting a duped category, and clear the selection. Normally this should only happen if you do a dupe mod category in another slot in order to mimic the game's functionality, but swapping in the same mod slot shouldn't have been an issue and now it won't be.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
