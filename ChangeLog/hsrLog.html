    <h1>Nov 20th, 2025 - BETA RELEASE</h1>
    This project is enormous and there are too many moving parts, frankly. It is likely that the beta will shit itself in 60 diff ways while you try to use it in this time.<br>
    PLEASE join the discord linked at the bottom of any page if you run into any bugs or if you have any feedback or suggestions<br>
    Anything is on the table for shit we could do.
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed query length limit bypass toggle not taking effect in a search.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when enemies died, the action order entry for that death would break analytics.</li>
        <li>Removed the bounce attack type on enemies. Didn't mean for that to slip through as an option. This will be added back later after I fix a bug related to enemy attacks that use bounce attack types.</li>
        <li>Removed buff condition for Benison of Paper and Rights as a default condition on saber's ultimate. Obv not everyone will be using sunday, and for people who are unfamiliar with user defined conditions removing it will avoid any extreme confusion on why she isn't ulting in a team with sunday if they didn't modify the conditions.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the user if very fucking stupid, could assign a negative value to enemy statistics, resulting in an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Tingyun when in slot 1, could cause a cyclic structure within the log(it gets stringified on the UI battle sim outside of the optimizer) which would break things.</li>
    </ul>
