    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to allow 2pc set mixing on the body relics, for each character individually. This also moves the settings toggle into Occlusion filters for each respective character on the team.
            <ul>
                <li>This does mean that the settings entry in search settings has been removed, no need for a team-based toggle on that setting when it exists for each character.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a check that will kill any query before it can launch, if the user has defined minimum substat roll values on character locks, that together exceed the total added rolls possible per character.
            <ul>
                <li>When this check triggers, you'll be met with a pop-up that will notify you of which character or characters are the ones that have too much on their minimum rolls.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to view Action Counts for each character in Analytics -> Summary, next to the various assorted totals for other things.</li>
        <li>Adjusted the page-load character config to no longer populate Saber at e6, or Sunday at e1. She was only there for testing purposes, obv you should be defaulting to e0 on a 5star character on page load.
            <ul>
                <li>I will clarify that whenever you change a character slot to a new 5star character, it will always default to e0, the only reason this is different is because it was from the page-load character config.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a healing icon to any healing actions that take place in an expanded action view. Similar to buffs, but instead of an up arrow or down arrow when a buff is removed, it will instead show the healing + sign between the healing source and the healing target.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where duplicate substats on a relic didn't always show an error when they should have, telling the user that duplicate substats are obv not good.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when changing the mainstat on a relic it would subvert some error message displays that should have displayed.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a substat had a conflict with a relic's mainstat, the error wouldn't display that would tell people that shouldn't be a thing.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a Harmony character used "But the Battle Isn't Over"(Bronya sig), it would try to apply its post-skill buff to non-buffable entities(summons, that aren't memosprites)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Bronya's skill advance could improperly cache who character 1 was in the team for the sake of targeting and actually applying the advance. The result was that sometimes the advance wouldn't apply.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where this changelog was showing TFD as the header value on a pageload instead of HSR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Nov 20th, 2025 - BETA RELEASE</h1>
    This project is enormous and there are too many moving parts, frankly. It is likely that the beta will shit itself in 60 diff ways while you try to use it in this time.<br>
    PLEASE join the discord linked at the bottom of any page if you run into any bugs or if you have any feedback or suggestions<br>
    Anything is on the table for shit we could do.
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed query length limit bypass toggle not taking effect in a search.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when enemies died, the action order entry for that death would break analytics.</li>
        <li>Removed the bounce attack type on enemies. Didn't mean for that to slip through as an option. This will be added back later after I fix a bug related to enemy attacks that use bounce attack types.</li>
        <li>Removed buff condition for Benison of Paper and Rights as a default condition on saber's ultimate. Obv not everyone will be using sunday, and for people who are unfamiliar with user defined conditions removing it will avoid any extreme confusion on why she isn't ulting in a team with sunday if they didn't modify the conditions.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the user if very fucking stupid, could assign a negative value to enemy statistics, resulting in an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Tingyun when in slot 1, could cause a cyclic structure within the log(it gets stringified on the UI battle sim outside of the optimizer) which would break things.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the user if very fucking stupid, could input duplicate characters in multiple slots. Yes I should have seen that coming, yes that's my bad for not thinking of it.</li>
        <li>In the same vein as the above note, added a feature to tell the user when there is a conflicting slot that would be a duplicate, as well as what slot it was that prevented them from adding that duplicate.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if the relics window was compacted, it could cut off the top and bottom of some relic edit windows, instead of scrolling properly.</li>
        <li>Moved where the trace stat summary display was in relation to the trace tree chart. This also resolves a UI issue where sometimes the trace stat summary would display where it should not.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on rotation conditions that used character stats, stats were included on the list that should not have been - namely composite stats like total ATK or action value that aren't actually building block stats but are composite stats. This resolves an issue where when selecting a stat that shouldn't have been there it would delete the character rotation condition object.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when selecting "Character: Special Value" it would populate the wrong dropdown list and default instead to "Character: State"</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when using a relic body set lock on either 2pc section, it would break the query. This was just an oversight on my part, my b.</li>
    </ul>
