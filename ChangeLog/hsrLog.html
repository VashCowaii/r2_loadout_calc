    <h1>Nov 24th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added missing mobile formatting on the Battle View tab. Not everything is perfect still, but it is viewable.</li>
        <li>Fixed a critical issue where gear(lightcones/relics) event listener ownership could persist in some cases, creating scenarios where an effect could take place on a character from gear they no longer had equipped.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where clicking an action in the Action Order from outside of the Action Details tab, wouldn't automatically take you to Action Details to view that action.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Tingyun's Benediction Additional DMG would still try to apply to a dead target, and cause an error.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 23th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to inspect a given result on the optimizer, and apply that result to the current team you have input on the battle simulator separate from the optimizer
            <ul>
                <li>When inspected, a result will show the in-game menu stats of each character that can be expanded if you care about them</li>
                <li>Another option given is the ability to expand "Example Relics" specific to that character and the substats allotted them, giving you a general idea of the kind of relics it would take in order to make something like that result. The idea here is that if you get something that requires 5 crit dmg rolls per relic that's obv some bullshit, and you don't want that, but if all it takes is getting a single crit dmg roll on each relic that's really no big deal.</li>
                <li>Lastly, if you click to apply that result, it will completely overwrite the lightcones, relics, and whatever other gear might be associated with a result in the future and replace your current selections in the team tab. This way you can apply a result and check what is going on in the battle in order to tell if you secretly fucked yourself on a rotation condition or not without having to guess.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Gallagher's skill heal still used a very old method in order to find who should be healed, resulting in some cases where no proper target could be found and cause an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Gallagher's default desired substat for Break Effect was improperly defined.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with detecting duplicate substats that I added yesterday that would sometimes not show the error when it should, or did show the error when it shouldn't</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Nov 22th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Relic substat percent value input now operates on percent values rather than decimal input. For the people that disliked typing .12 instead 12, you win.
            <ul>
                <li>This does NOT change how exports are handled. This is ONLY a user-facing change, and how values are actually processed is the exact same.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added roll restrictions to each substat relic. This is a little weird so let me explain.
            <ul>
                <li>As like before, when a stat is input, it will estimate on average the roll count that it would take to reach the value that you input on that substat.
                    <ul>
                        <li>As an example, a SPD value of exactly 13 would estimate 5 rolls to reach that point because with mixed high/mid/low values that is realistic</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>However, estimates don't really let us enforce a 5 maximum roll limit, so what would happen if someone enters in a higher value on the next substat?
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this case, it would look at the first value again, and it knows that on SPD the highest value per roll possible is 2.6, and 2.6 * 4 + (base roll 2.6) = 13 meaning that 4 rolls is the lowest possible roll value that could contain 13. At this point, the roll value state will change from the estimated 5 to the bounded 4</li>
                        <li>Now the next value that you input will be evaluated in the same way. If you happened to input like 15% crit rate, it will be restricted instead to the highest possible crit rate value using 1 roll since only 1 roll was leftover from the SPD substat on this relic</li>
                        <li>From top to bottom, substats will prioritize roll counts and restrict any subsequent rolls based on how many are leftover from those upper substats</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In this way, we can ensure that users are not setting 4 rolls of crit rate at 15% each.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Given the above note, I have also added roll count display values on the relic edit menu.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to customize enemy resistance values beyond the simple 20% and 40% that we allowed for before.
            <ul>
                <li>This change was made since there are technically enemies in the game that aren't weak to an element in terms of toughness reduction, but still have 0% RES against that element. It's weird, but it happens. Also there are enemies that have 60% RES that I forgot about, and you can specify that amount now.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Changing a battle or enemy setting will no longer force the Battle View to be on the Analytics tab. If you just changed an enemy setting, you'll stay on the enemy settings page.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a user input an extremely high or perfect 5x roll on a relic, the rolls count would improperly estimate how many rolls were actually on that relic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Nov 21th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to allow 2pc set mixing on the body relics, for each character individually. This also moves the settings toggle into Occlusion filters for each respective character on the team.
            <ul>
                <li>This does mean that the settings entry in search settings has been removed, no need for a team-based toggle on that setting when it exists for each character.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a check that will kill any query before it can launch, if the user has defined minimum substat roll values on character locks, that together exceed the total added rolls possible per character.
            <ul>
                <li>When this check triggers, you'll be met with a pop-up that will notify you of which character or characters are the ones that have too much on their minimum rolls.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to view Action Counts for each character in Analytics -> Summary, next to the various assorted totals for other things.</li>
        <li>Adjusted the page-load character config to no longer populate Saber at e6, or Sunday at e1. She was only there for testing purposes, obv you should be defaulting to e0 on a 5star character on page load.
            <ul>
                <li>I will clarify that whenever you change a character slot to a new 5star character, it will always default to e0, the only reason this is different is because it was from the page-load character config.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a healing icon to any healing actions that take place in an expanded action view. Similar to buffs, but instead of an up arrow or down arrow when a buff is removed, it will instead show the healing + sign between the healing source and the healing target.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where duplicate substats on a relic didn't always show an error when they should have, telling the user that duplicate substats are obv not good.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when changing the mainstat on a relic it would subvert some error message displays that should have displayed.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a substat had a conflict with a relic's mainstat, the error wouldn't display that would tell people that shouldn't be a thing.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a Harmony character used "But the Battle Isn't Over"(Bronya sig), it would try to apply its post-skill buff to non-buffable entities(summons, that aren't memosprites)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Bronya's skill advance could improperly cache who character 1 was in the team for the sake of targeting and actually applying the advance. The result was that sometimes the advance wouldn't apply.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a user was dumb as fuck and used the Firefox browser, images in the Action Order did not display properly
            <ul>
                <li>Added note: Fuck firefox.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where this changelog was showing TFD as the header value on a pageload instead of HSR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Nov 20th, 2025 - BETA RELEASE</h1>
    This project is enormous and there are too many moving parts, frankly. It is likely that the beta will shit itself in 60 diff ways while you try to use it in this time.<br>
    PLEASE join the discord linked at the bottom of any page if you run into any bugs or if you have any feedback or suggestions<br>
    Anything is on the table for shit we could do.
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed query length limit bypass toggle not taking effect in a search.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when enemies died, the action order entry for that death would break analytics.</li>
        <li>Removed the bounce attack type on enemies. Didn't mean for that to slip through as an option. This will be added back later after I fix a bug related to enemy attacks that use bounce attack types.</li>
        <li>Removed buff condition for Benison of Paper and Rights as a default condition on saber's ultimate. Obv not everyone will be using sunday, and for people who are unfamiliar with user defined conditions removing it will avoid any extreme confusion on why she isn't ulting in a team with sunday if they didn't modify the conditions.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the user if very fucking stupid, could assign a negative value to enemy statistics, resulting in an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Tingyun when in slot 1, could cause a cyclic structure within the log(it gets stringified on the UI battle sim outside of the optimizer) which would break things.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the user if very fucking stupid, could input duplicate characters in multiple slots. Yes I should have seen that coming, yes that's my bad for not thinking of it.</li>
        <li>In the same vein as the above note, added a feature to tell the user when there is a conflicting slot that would be a duplicate, as well as what slot it was that prevented them from adding that duplicate.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if the relics window was compacted, it could cut off the top and bottom of some relic edit windows, instead of scrolling properly.</li>
        <li>Moved where the trace stat summary display was in relation to the trace tree chart. This also resolves a UI issue where sometimes the trace stat summary would display where it should not.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on rotation conditions that used character stats, stats were included on the list that should not have been - namely composite stats like total ATK or action value that aren't actually building block stats but are composite stats. This resolves an issue where when selecting a stat that shouldn't have been there it would delete the character rotation condition object.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when selecting "Character: Special Value" it would populate the wrong dropdown list and default instead to "Character: State"</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when using a relic body set lock on either 2pc section, it would break the query. This was just an oversight on my part, my b.</li>
    </ul>
