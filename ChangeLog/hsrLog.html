    <h1>Dec 22th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the Event Reader homepage.</li>
        <li>Added the Event Reader to the Resources tab on the header.</li>
        <li>Added the following lightcones to the Event Reader:
            <ul>
                <li>Baptism of Pure Thought</li>
                <li>Meshing Cogs</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Behind-the-scenes changes in preparation for the upcoming Event-Reader tool.(I have not just been sitting doing nothing, lmao)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 10th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated damage/hit inspections to also now have the option to view DMG Stats and DMG Multipliers.
            <ul>
                <li>DMG Stats will show the sum total of all bonuses that fed into a given calculation. This distinction is important because something like Bronya's Basic ATK might have 5% crit rate on her normal stat sheet but due to her trace she gets 100% crit rate on Basic ATKs. Her regular stat sheet will show 5% but the DMG Stats will show 100% to account for that bonus. This stat table shows ALL bonuses that relate to the dmg.</li>
                <li>DMG Multipliers will show all multipliers involved in the calculation. DMG%, vuln, RES, DEF, DR, etc. These numbers will be displayed in multiplier form so 30% DMG is a 1.3x multiplier.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 9th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Renamed the "Overview" tab to "Character" for added clarity.</li>
        <li>Added icons to the Team tab menu selectors for:
            <ul>
                <li>Rotation</li>
                <li>Character</li>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 7th, 2025 - THE IMPORTS UPDATE(yes, that one)</h1>
    This update adds the ability to import your in-game showcase characters, using enka api.
    <ul>
        <li>As mentioned above, added the ability to import characters by UID lookup.
            <ul>
                <li>After retreiving a showcase, the showcase data will be stored in the browser cache, meaning if all you want to do is access a different character you don't need to search again because we saved the data locally.</li>
                <li>Showcase characters will ONLY show up to use if you also have a character in the currently selected team that matches a showcase character. As an example: Say you have Saber on your showcase. You would need Saber in the team on the simulator in order for the export menu to show you the option to overwrite the team's Saber with the Showcase Saber</li>
                <li>When you do have a matching character on the team and overwrite them with showcase data, it only overwrites gear selections. Rotation conditions should remain if you had any before.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Robin's lightcone (Flowing Nightglow) wasn't properly accounting for Cadenza dmg bonus to allies. In particular it wasn't triggering Cadenza unless she had 5 Cantillation but the stacks aren't needed.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the filters locks minimum sub rolls count wasn't properly factoring against the total added roll pool.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 6th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to graph by Stats on a character or memosprite across damage instances in a battle.
            <ul>
                <li>Note that to start the stats that we extract on this graph will only be for the character's main stat sheet. This means in the case of someone like Bronya who has a 100% crit rate trace that only applies to basic attacks, then the 100% crit rate wouldn't be found because it is action tagged to basic attacks and exists outside of the main stat sheet.</li>
                <li>This is something I plan to change later, obviously when dealing damage we manage to extract all relevant stats from all tables and sources even on the enemy themselves, but extracting that after the fact for a chart is a little different so I'll do that tomorrow.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to specify on EACH enemy, how much energy they give characters they hit, each time they hit. So if your boss enemy you set to 20 energy per hit and they have a bounce attack that hits 5 times, that would be 20 * 5 = 100 total energy gain and that's obviously not very realistic so please be careful with this setting.</li>
        <li>Added the ability in Battle Settings to dictate the starting energy % of all characters in the team. Please note though that this will not influence characters with special energy bars like Castorice or Acheron who have predined starting values for their energy.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where DHPT additional dmg had an improper cache access making it so the Addditional DMG procs from souldragon follow up attacks could access the wrong multi in regards to its dmg bonus or def shred etc.</li>
        <li>In regards to the above fix, it's bc of that bug that when testing I could line up dmg for souldragon's Additional DMG proc when trying to prove it didn't inherit sunday's E1 shred fully and it does. Have no problem admitting a mistake, but that's why.
            <ul>
                <li>In regards to souldragon's own dmg it does not modify it still other than if sunday targets dan instead.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Changed how sunday's buffs display in the buff view inspect for the sake of his E1(doesn't actually change how they apply, just a visual adjustment)</li>
        <li>Updated Mem's half of the RMC joint attack to ignore toughness types and reduce toughness universally.
            <ul>
                <li>This is actually how it works in game and I've known about it since the EBA was added to RMC, but I had sent in a support ticket for a bug report.</li>
                <li>As of this morning, my ticket was closed after a bunch of escalations in their customer service, so I take that to mean they have intent to fix it, so I'm updating the calc to match the game then.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 5th, 2025 - THE LOW-AV SEARCH UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to target lowest AV in the optimizer, just be aware that if enemies never die then you'll never finish the battle and all results will be the same: the max AV possible allowed for that fight.</li>
        <li>Added the Turn-View chart in analytics which was initially withheld from the beta since I wasn't sure on how to make it not look like shit.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where filter exports were using file extensions that were just barely too long preventing actual exports for filters.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the optimizer results gain/loss bars, or the relative to equipment bars could be invisible due to a scenario where your reference battle sim on Battle view had a result that was lower or higher than the lowest low or highest high in the sim. Adjustments have been made so in such a case your ref result will be used in place of the floor or ceiling until the optimizer can find a result worse than or better than the ref.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where DHPT souldragon attack damage was less than it should have been because it was still hardcoded for a sub level 10 trace when I tested him.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the lightcone "Though Worlds Apart" wasn't applying the extra damage bonus to allies with active summons.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 4th, 2025 - THE SAVE FILES UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The export/import schema used everywhere in the site has changed from clipboard data to actual file data.
            <ul>
                <li>Primary reason is most of you are storing the data in files anyways, this just cuts out an extra step for you.</li>
                <li>It also makes it a little more convenient for myself in the future when you guys give me bug reports if you can hand me a file instead of complaining about discord's text limit preventing you from posting your filters.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 3th, 2025 - THE CACHED CHARACTERS UPDATE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to specify what team you want to show when the page first loads in a given browser session. Page-load teams can be specified in the Export menu.
            <ul>
                <li>You can either specify a full team, or none at all and it will default to the standard saber team you're used to seeing.</li>
                <li>When a custom team is set, it will load cached character data by default for each team member.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to cache character data for each character. Characters can be cached in the Export menu.
            <ul>
                <li>So say you have a specific saber setup, maybe +1 or base spd, and you want that to be her default data then you would open the export menu and click "Save To" under the cache tab under Saber's image.</li>
                <li>When cached data is detected for a given character, then whenever that character is freshly selected in a slot(say you move from Saber to Silver Wolf in a slot) then that slot will first look if there is cached data and if there is it will load that instead of the default character info.</li>
                <li>Please for the love of fuck and all that holy, know that this is NOT meant to replace character exports. If you clear your browser cache you will delete all your stored character data. Exporting your data and storing it in a file somewhere is the only guaranteed way to ensure that you preserve your character and/or team</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When inspecting a character's dmg/heal/turn etc instance, the buff list will now the source owner icon next to the source name. So in the case of Saber's lightcone the ATK buff will say the lc name as the source, but saber's icon as the source owner. In this way, if you're ever confused about where exactly a buff is coming from and from whom, this should clear that up.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when using Silver Wolf in a search, one of her desired stats(EHR) was improperly defined causing an error.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 2th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated the Lightcone menu used in both character input and filter input
            <ul>
                <li>The text-filtered input used in Filters has been replaced a button that pulls up the regular lightcone menu used on character input.</li>
                <li>Tags now display under each lightcone where applicable, the tags being:
                    <ul>
                        <li>SU (Herta shop lightcones)</li>
                        <li>Battlepass (Nameless Honor lightcones)</li>
                        <li>MoC (Endgame shop lightcones)</li>
                        <li>Starlight (Starlight exchange lightcones)</li>
                        <li>Stellar (Stellar exchange lightcones)</li>
                        <li>Character names (Signature lightcone owners, for 5star lightcones only)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The search now allows you to search by those tag names, assuming you typed them out fully</li>
                <li>The search now allows you to search by Signature owners, even partially unlike the other tags ("dan heng" would yield both DHIL and DHPT lightcones)</li>
                <li>When a lightcone option is clicked/tapped in the filter version of the menu, it will remove the lightcone from the menu and add it to the filter list instead. Filtered lightcones won't show up on the menu to help avoid confusion.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a half-heart icon for consume related instances viewable from an Action inspect on the Action Details tab.</li>
        <li>Updated the Eidolon menu. Have been unhappy with how it looked for a long while now, and it's still not perfect but it looks better than before.
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking an eidolon icon can now also change the eidolon rank for that character.</li>
                <li>A list of level bonuses provided to any skill by any eidolon will now show when level bonuses are provided.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Trailblazer - Remembrance enhanced basic attack wasn't counting fully as an attack instance for the sake of triggers(the bug report being: it didn't proc robin's ultimate additional dmg).</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if using the new arrow key action jumps in the Action Details tab while filtered, it wouldn't jump to the next action.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where example relics couldn't generate because they weren't updated for the custom desired substats update a couple days back, just an oversight.</li>
        <li>Slight changes on how character data gets stored. Not intentional but this does result in a tiny reduction in file size for raw character data.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Dec 1th, 2025 - The No-more-input-update-lag update</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed the lag that was caused after any change made to characters, enemies, settings etc. Made some changes in how the UI is generated after each battle. In relation to the Action Order display in particular, I had a very old method in there that was very slow and I just overlooked removing and updating it to a faster method so that's my bad. Battle updates are now instant, even on a huge battle.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to further filter the action order by entity: characters 1-4, summons, or enemies.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to use Arrow Keys (left and right) in order to change the action inspected on Action Details on Battle View.</li>
        <li>Added arrow buttons that accomplish the same thing as arrow keys as mentioned above, under each action's expanded header title.</li>
        <li>Added a highlight for the current action selected, now it will display with a blue-ish gradient background and revert when switched off of.</li>
        <li>Added auto-centering for when a new action is selected on the Action Order, this is particularly more beneficial for mobile users but still looks pretty on desktop too.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where filtering actions would improperly assign the action number from the log, so when you filtered and opened up a new action it would open up the wrong action on the display.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 30th, 2025 - Custom Desired Substats Update</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to modify the 4 desired substats on character lock filters.
            <ul>
                <li>Just as an example, Tribbie in the beta has always populated with no SPD stat as a desired stat, this meant that you were always forced to search for Slow tribbie, but now you can modify any of the 4 desired stats to be speed instead for those of you with the DDD fetish.</li>
                <li>If you attempt to select a duplicate desired stat that is already selected in another slot, you'll be alerted on which slot you would be duplicating.</li>
                <li>If you define a new desired stat that happens to be a stat you already defined in your Trash Stat priority, it will take priority on the desired stat and delete the trash stat. This will reorder the trash stat priority you had set.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updated the following log actions to have more images when inspecting any action in the action order. You guys like your unga bunga picture books, I try to oblige:
            <ul>
                <li>Break: now shows break icon, character icon, and enemy icon.</li>
                <li>DoT: shows dot type icon, dot icon, break icon if it was break dot, character icon and enemy icon.</li>
                <li>Hit: shows attack icon, enemy icon, and character icon.</li>
                <li>Additional DMG: shows attack icon with a "+" to distinguish it from regular hits, enemy icon, and character icon.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to filter the Action Order on the battle simulator. Note that this does not change the outcome of a battle, it only filters what "Header" actions will display on the action bar.
            <ul>
                <li>Later I will probably add the ability to filter by entities rather than just actions, but not today.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added turn start action visual displays for character internal states or values that didn't have them yet for the following character:
            <ul>
                <li>Tingyun
                    <ul>
                        <li>Benediction Target</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Huohuo
                    <ul>
                        <li>Divine Provision</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Gallagher
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic Enhanced</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Tribbie
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numinosity</li>
                        <li>Ult zone</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Bronya
                    <ul>
                        <li>E1 Skill point regen ready</li>
                        <li>E4 follow-up attack ready</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that prevented Gallagher's ultimate from advancing himself even if it was cast in the post-action phase of his turn(where it should work)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Bronya's E4 follow-up attack was still triggering even against non-wind-weak enemies, and when it did trigger it didn't target specifically the wind-weak enemy that was hit.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the header navigation on Mobile-View failed to expand when tapped due to a missing file I completely forgot to upload back when beta started.</li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 29th, 2025 - The Big Search Update (Substats changes)</h1>
    This changes how searches get handled in relation to substat iterations on each character. For most of you, this will reduce search sizes by about ~66%. That is a lot. If you chase perfect builds though nothing will change.<br>
    Nothing was actually wrong with how I was doing it before, but the way we're handling it now is more faithful to search settings specified by the user.
    <ul>
        <li>Changed how searches are handled in order to be more faithful to settings, when it comes to substats.
            <ul>
                <li>Usable Base Rolls, a setting that didn't use to impact search size, now impacts search size by quite a lot.</li>
                <li>Rolls per Relic modified search size before and still does, but is more impactful to the search size.</li>
                <li>The optimizer will now fill out relics completely, this matters when say Robin is using ATK% body, feet, orb, and rope. Obviously you can't have ATK% on those 4 items, so what fills in instead? A trash stat.</li>
                <li>Default trash stats have been assigned to each character that will populate by default</li>
                <li>The user can now modify the aforementioned trash stats and specify priority so if you want ATK Flat to fill in before Effect RES does, then you can specify that.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Given the above, I've adjusted the default Usable Base Rolls setting to 20, up from 12. 12 is way too restrictive now that Base Rolls actually impacts search sizes.
            <ul>
                <li>Please don't misunderstand though, even at 20 that will cut most search sizes in half. This is still a tremendous upgrade over before for most of you.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to read a character's Ultimate queue state from the "Character: State" condition.
            <ul>
                <li>Note that this conditions only reads true if an ultimate is currently inside the queue and not completed.</li>
                <li>As an example, if Acheron wants to ult after Silver Wolf does in order to ensure that the DEF Shred debuff is on enemies, then you could set an ult condition on Acheron to read the queue state of SW ult first before deciding to enter the queue herself or not.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that prevented relic-specific buffs from being chart options on Buff Uptime in Analytics. This is one I just straight up forgot to allow for so my bad.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that prevented individual character Technique toggles from working properly. Team-wide tech toggle still worked, it was the individual ones only that broke.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that prevented new enemies from being added to a wave. Existing enemies could still be edited, though.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue "Character: State" conditions could break on characters that didn't have any states to read.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 26th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed Tribbie sig LC failing to apply energy gain on FUA attacks.</li>
        <li>(Visual only) Fixed the following gear pieces not being found in the Buff Uptime chart with their respective buffs. Some of these were just really old in terms of when I coded them and while they functioned properly, their buffs weren't coded as options to find in the chart:
            <ul>

    <h1>Nov 25th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to disable characters on the Battle View simulation.
            <ul>
                <li>This is mainly for debugging purposes and most of you won't give a shit, but please note that this will not disable them in the optimizer, only the Battle View.</li>
                <li>Character 1 can never be disabled as there are numerous things that rely on not only one character being active, but also on a character being in slot 1.</li>
                <li>This toggle can be found on the Rotations menu of each character, and is saved to each character's import/export data.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a limit on BASE SPD only, on custom enemies, at 300 max. Lookin at you, people who set enemy spd to 2k+ and crashed their browsers due to enemies taking nearly infinite actions.</li>
        <li>Slight adjustments to the character data or filter export menus, still kinda looks like shit but with character images in there I do think it looks <i>slightly</i> better.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that could occur when the first substat input was input higher than should be allowed. There were several problems that were tied to this, not gonna bother listing them out.</li>
        <li>Removed extra decimal places from substat entry displays after user input. This does not mean we don't use decimals anymore, I'm only talking about the floating point decimals that would appear so if you did Break Effect at 6.48% it would show 6.480000000003 or other shit like that.</li>
        <li>Fixed Saber's Crown of the Star buff source claiming it was from E1 rather than her trace. Visual issue only.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 24th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added missing mobile formatting on the Battle View tab. Not everything is perfect still, but it is viewable.</li>
        <li>Fixed a critical issue where gear(lightcones/relics) event listener ownership could persist in some cases, creating scenarios where an effect could take place on a character from gear they no longer had equipped.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where clicking an action in the Action Order from outside of the Action Details tab, wouldn't automatically take you to Action Details to view that action.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Tingyun's Benediction Additional DMG would still try to apply to a dead target, and cause an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Robin's ult could advance summons that weren't memosprites.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 23th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to inspect a given result on the optimizer, and apply that result to the current team you have input on the battle simulator separate from the optimizer
            <ul>
                <li>When inspected, a result will show the in-game menu stats of each character that can be expanded if you care about them</li>
                <li>Another option given is the ability to expand "Example Relics" specific to that character and the substats allotted them, giving you a general idea of the kind of relics it would take in order to make something like that result. The idea here is that if you get something that requires 5 crit dmg rolls per relic that's obv some bullshit, and you don't want that, but if all it takes is getting a single crit dmg roll on each relic that's really no big deal.</li>
                <li>Lastly, if you click to apply that result, it will completely overwrite the lightcones, relics, and whatever other gear might be associated with a result in the future and replace your current selections in the team tab. This way you can apply a result and check what is going on in the battle in order to tell if you secretly fucked yourself on a rotation condition or not without having to guess.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Gallagher's skill heal still used a very old method in order to find who should be healed, resulting in some cases where no proper target could be found and cause an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Gallagher's default desired substat for Break Effect was improperly defined.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue with detecting duplicate substats that I added yesterday that would sometimes not show the error when it should, or did show the error when it shouldn't</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 22th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Relic substat percent value input now operates on percent values rather than decimal input. For the people that disliked typing .12 instead 12, you win.
            <ul>
                <li>This does NOT change how exports are handled. This is ONLY a user-facing change, and how values are actually processed is the exact same.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added roll restrictions to each substat relic. This is a little weird so let me explain.
            <ul>
                <li>As like before, when a stat is input, it will estimate on average the roll count that it would take to reach the value that you input on that substat.
                    <ul>
                        <li>As an example, a SPD value of exactly 13 would estimate 5 rolls to reach that point because with mixed high/mid/low values that is realistic</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>However, estimates don't really let us enforce a 5 maximum roll limit, so what would happen if someone enters in a higher value on the next substat?
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this case, it would look at the first value again, and it knows that on SPD the highest value per roll possible is 2.6, and 2.6 * 4 + (base roll 2.6) = 13 meaning that 4 rolls is the lowest possible roll value that could contain 13. At this point, the roll value state will change from the estimated 5 to the bounded 4</li>
                        <li>Now the next value that you input will be evaluated in the same way. If you happened to input like 15% crit rate, it will be restricted instead to the highest possible crit rate value using 1 roll since only 1 roll was leftover from the SPD substat on this relic</li>
                        <li>From top to bottom, substats will prioritize roll counts and restrict any subsequent rolls based on how many are leftover from those upper substats</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In this way, we can ensure that users are not setting 4 rolls of crit rate at 15% each.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Given the above note, I have also added roll count display values on the relic edit menu.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to customize enemy resistance values beyond the simple 20% and 40% that we allowed for before.
            <ul>
                <li>This change was made since there are technically enemies in the game that aren't weak to an element in terms of toughness reduction, but still have 0% RES against that element. It's weird, but it happens. Also there are enemies that have 60% RES that I forgot about, and you can specify that amount now.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Changing a battle or enemy setting will no longer force the Battle View to be on the Analytics tab. If you just changed an enemy setting, you'll stay on the enemy settings page.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a user input an extremely high or perfect 5x roll on a relic, the rolls count would improperly estimate how many rolls were actually on that relic.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Nov 21th, 2025</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to allow 2pc set mixing on the body relics, for each character individually. This also moves the settings toggle into Occlusion filters for each respective character on the team.
            <ul>
                <li>This does mean that the settings entry in search settings has been removed, no need for a team-based toggle on that setting when it exists for each character.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a check that will kill any query before it can launch, if the user has defined minimum substat roll values on character locks, that together exceed the total added rolls possible per character.
            <ul>
                <li>When this check triggers, you'll be met with a pop-up that will notify you of which character or characters are the ones that have too much on their minimum rolls.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the ability to view Action Counts for each character in Analytics -> Summary, next to the various assorted totals for other things.</li>
        <li>Adjusted the page-load character config to no longer populate Saber at e6, or Sunday at e1. She was only there for testing purposes, obv you should be defaulting to e0 on a 5star character on page load.
            <ul>
                <li>I will clarify that whenever you change a character slot to a new 5star character, it will always default to e0, the only reason this is different is because it was from the page-load character config.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added a healing icon to any healing actions that take place in an expanded action view. Similar to buffs, but instead of an up arrow or down arrow when a buff is removed, it will instead show the healing + sign between the healing source and the healing target.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where duplicate substats on a relic didn't always show an error when they should have, telling the user that duplicate substats are obv not good.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when changing the mainstat on a relic it would subvert some error message displays that should have displayed.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a substat had a conflict with a relic's mainstat, the error wouldn't display that would tell people that shouldn't be a thing.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a Harmony character used "But the Battle Isn't Over"(Bronya sig), it would try to apply its post-skill buff to non-buffable entities(summons, that aren't memosprites)</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Bronya's skill advance could improperly cache who character 1 was in the team for the sake of targeting and actually applying the advance. The result was that sometimes the advance wouldn't apply.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if a user was dumb as fuck and used the Firefox browser, images in the Action Order did not display properly
            <ul>
                <li>Added note: Fuck firefox.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where this changelog was showing TFD as the header value on a pageload instead of HSR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Nov 20th, 2025 - BETA RELEASE</h1>
    This project is enormous and there are too many moving parts, frankly. It is likely that the beta will shit itself in 60 diff ways while you try to use it in this time.<br>
    PLEASE join the discord linked at the bottom of any page if you run into any bugs or if you have any feedback or suggestions<br>
    Anything is on the table for shit we could do.
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed query length limit bypass toggle not taking effect in a search.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when enemies died, the action order entry for that death would break analytics.</li>
        <li>Removed the bounce attack type on enemies. Didn't mean for that to slip through as an option. This will be added back later after I fix a bug related to enemy attacks that use bounce attack types.</li>
        <li>Removed buff condition for Benison of Paper and Rights as a default condition on saber's ultimate. Obv not everyone will be using sunday, and for people who are unfamiliar with user defined conditions removing it will avoid any extreme confusion on why she isn't ulting in a team with sunday if they didn't modify the conditions.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the user if very fucking stupid, could assign a negative value to enemy statistics, resulting in an error.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where Tingyun when in slot 1, could cause a cyclic structure within the log(it gets stringified on the UI battle sim outside of the optimizer) which would break things.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the user if very fucking stupid, could input duplicate characters in multiple slots. Yes I should have seen that coming, yes that's my bad for not thinking of it.</li>
        <li>In the same vein as the above note, added a feature to tell the user when there is a conflicting slot that would be a duplicate, as well as what slot it was that prevented them from adding that duplicate.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where if the relics window was compacted, it could cut off the top and bottom of some relic edit windows, instead of scrolling properly.</li>
        <li>Moved where the trace stat summary display was in relation to the trace tree chart. This also resolves a UI issue where sometimes the trace stat summary would display where it should not.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where on rotation conditions that used character stats, stats were included on the list that should not have been - namely composite stats like total ATK or action value that aren't actually building block stats but are composite stats. This resolves an issue where when selecting a stat that shouldn't have been there it would delete the character rotation condition object.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when selecting "Character: Special Value" it would populate the wrong dropdown list and default instead to "Character: State"</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where when using a relic body set lock on either 2pc section, it would break the query. This was just an oversight on my part, my b.</li>
    </ul>
