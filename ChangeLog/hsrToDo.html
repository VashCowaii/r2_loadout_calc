    <h1>Will Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom energy gains as part of battle settings</li>
        <li>Mode-specific mechanics(MoC, PF, AS, AA)</li>
        <li>Literally anything to make the project more accurate, or faster</li>
        <li>Add a code specific wiki with entries for each character/lightcone/relic etc.<br>
        I say code specific because I wouldn't be elaborating on how characters should work, but rather how they actually work in game and in my code. Descriptions do not always align with what is happening.</li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h1>Might Do: (or Extremely low priority tasks)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I'll add things here later as I think of them</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Will Not Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Expanded builds sharing logic (probably)</li>
        <li>Accounts/sign-ins(with the singular exception of allowing loadout saves in the cloud instead of locally later, possibly, but likely no)</li>
        <li>Anything that far exceeds the bounds of a <i><b>calculator/optimizer</b></i><br>
        I am not your wiki. Use other sites for that.</li>
    </ul>
