<div>
    <h1>Will Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom energy gains as part of battle settings</li>
        <li>Mode-specific mechanics(MoC, PF, AS, AA)</li>
        <li>Literally anything to make the project more accurate, or faster</li>
        <li>Add a code specific wiki with entries for each character/lightcone/relic etc.<br>
        I say code specific because I wouldn't be elaborating on how characters should work, but rather how they actually work in game and in my code. Descriptions do not always align with what is happening.</li>
        <li></li>

<div>
    <h1>Might Do: (or Extremely low priority tasks)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I'll add things here later as I think of them</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Things disabled/removed/adjusted in beta:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Enemy attack types other than ST and AOE (had a bug with bounce attacks sourced from enemies, need to fix that first)</li>
        <li>Enemy HP or Toughness bars greater than 1, there are some edge cases on how these reset that I still don't understand but I'll add that back in once I finish testing.</li>
        <li>Graphs for Stat view, or Custom view. Just fugly as hell and I'm still not sure how to make them prettier.</li>
        <li>Lowest-AV search on the opimizer.</li>
        <li>Lightcones with no code say "Not added yet"</li>
        <li>Characters with no code don't show at all</li>
        <li>Tag filters: they're too easy to screw up right now and I want people to be familiar with the optimizer in general before they touch these</li>
        <li>The ability to disable smart skips. Same reason as tag filters.</li>
        <li>The ability to change the amount of energy gained from each hit applied to allies from enemies.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Will Not Do:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Expanded builds sharing logic (probably)</li>
        <li>Accounts/sign-ins(with the singular exception of allowing loadout saves in the cloud instead of locally later, possibly, but likely no)</li>
        <li>Anything that far exceeds the bounds of a <i><b>calculator/optimizer</b></i><br>
        I am not your wiki. Use other sites for that.</li>
    </ul>
